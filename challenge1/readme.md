As part of challenge 1, 
Basic setup can be of accessing a VM from DNS and DB can be connected to VM. Module for that can be created for increasing productivity.

Load Balancer --> MIG --> VM --> DB

I have just tried to show approach to write code creatig MIG and template for creating multi network VM ( 2 networks ). Sothat DNS can be connect to 1 network and DB can be connected to another network to avoid direct access of external user to DB. 

Code of CloudSQL DB creation and connection with VM can also be added
